# Changelog

## 0.1.2

<sub>2026-08-20</sub>

- _(patch)_
  InstrumentedActor mirrors the new on("error") overload on AnyActor so instrumented actors stay assignable to their originals.
- _(patch)_
  Deleted the internal registry and its `@mantaq/core/internal` entry point. Output fan-out is now a public `on("output")` subscriber hook; actors gained public `inject(event)` and terminal `dispose()`.

## 0.1.1

<sub>2026-08-13</sub>

- _(patch)_
  Added actor recovery, transition observability, snapshot state payloads, and hardened clocks against invalid ms; fixed error-report accuracy and made the test harness context-generic. Banned console.* in library src — failures now throw (misconfiguration) or route to the error state (runtime), with platform-matching clock delay clamping.

## 0.1.0

<sub>2026-08-12</sub>

- _(minor)_
  Breaking: events are now envelopes { type, payload } instead of flat { id, ...payload }. EventRef.id renamed to .type. Payload id can no longer be clobbered by the event type. All payload reads move to event.payload.*
- _(patch)_ sync dependents to core 0.0.3
- _(patch)_ Fixed exports in committed package.json pointing at missing dist; vp pack rewrites them at publish time
- _(patch)_
  Added universal terminal error state for contained user errors; send() no longer throws and errors surface via snapshot().error.

## 0.0.2

<sub>2026-08-09</sub>

- _(patch)_
  Context in handlers and effects is now a handle (`context.get()` / `context.set()`), and `set()` replaces the whole context — so context writes emit a `change` event even without a transition. Snapshots now carry `context`, and change handlers receive the previous snapshot (`(snapshot, prev)`) for identity comparison.

## 0.0.1

<sub>2026-08-09</sub>

- _(patch)_
  First 0.0.1 release: actor-model state machine runtime (hierarchical states, events, effects, virtual clock) with sugar helpers, graph traversal/coverage, test harness, seeded property-based testing, and the shared Either utility — all north-star quality gates enforced.

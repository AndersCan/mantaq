# Changelog

## 0.2.2

<sub>2026-11-03</sub>

- _(patch)_ Updated dependency `@mantaq/core` v0.5.3

## 0.2.1

<sub>2026-11-03</sub>

- _(patch)_ README: separate the static walk (nothing runs) from the live page (steps run the real actor).

## 0.2.0

<sub>2026-11-02</sub>

- _(minor)_
  States, events and edges carry a `doc` field (schema v8): `@mantaq/inspect` reads the
  leading JSDoc of `state(...)` / `event(...)` declarations and of `m.on` / `m.onAny`
  calls, and the viewer panel shows it for the current state and each next step.
- _(minor)_
  `mantaq inspect --check` exits 1 when the analysis reports design errors or warnings, including fuzz handler errors, so it can gate CI.
- _(minor)_
  `mantaq inspect --config FILE --mode MODE` loads the files with your project's Vite config, so env, aliases and plugins resolve as they do in your app. A file that fails to load now makes the CLI exit 1.
- _(minor)_
  The Vite plugin page now runs your machines for real: send inputs, advance the virtual clock and step back, with the walk kept in the URL and replayed on the new code when you save.
- _(patch)_ README: export factories so `mantaq-inspect` can fuzz them; links the new "Machines in an application" guide.

## 0.1.0

<sub>2026-11-01</sub>

- _(minor)_
  First public release. `@mantaq/viz` draws and walks a machine from a versioned
  JSON document; `@mantaq/inspect` turns a machine into that document and ships the
  `mantaq-inspect` CLI and a Vite plugin (`@mantaq/inspect/vite`).

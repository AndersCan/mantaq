# Changelog

## 0.2.3

<sub>2026-11-03</sub>

- _(patch)_
  The JSDoc above `m.effect(...)` becomes the doc of the state's effect edge, and the walkthrough shows it under "Entering <state> runs".

## 0.2.2

<sub>2026-11-03</sub>

- _(patch)_ Updated dependency `@mantaq/utils` v0.0.5

## 0.2.1

<sub>2026-11-03</sub>

- _(patch)_ README: separate the static walk (nothing runs) from the live page (steps run the real actor).

## 0.2.0

<sub>2026-11-02</sub>

- _(minor)_
  States, events and edges carry a `doc` field (schema v8): `@mantaq/inspect` reads the
  leading JSDoc of `state(...)` / `event(...)` declarations and of `m.on` / `m.onAny`
  calls, and the viewer panel shows it for the current state and each next step.
- _(minor)_
  `VizDriver` and `VizLiveState` types, and `mountViewer(root, doc, { driver })`: with a
  driver the explore panel sends each step to the running actor, follows its real state and
  shows the outcome (transition, stay, ignored), effects run, context and handler errors.
- _(minor)_
  Live mode controls: one button per pending timer, a free "advance ms" input, payload entry
  (JSON box or a sample the fuzzer sent), and `?step=` links that carry advances and payloads
  and replay through the driver on open.

## 0.1.0

<sub>2026-11-01</sub>

- _(minor)_
  First public release. `@mantaq/viz` draws and walks a machine from a versioned
  JSON document; `@mantaq/inspect` turns a machine into that document and ships the
  `mantaq-inspect` CLI and a Vite plugin (`@mantaq/inspect/vite`).

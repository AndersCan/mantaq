# Changelog

## 0.1.0

<sub>2026-08-12</sub>

- _(minor)_
  Breaking: events are now envelopes { type, payload } instead of flat { id, ...payload }. EventRef.id renamed to .type. Payload id can no longer be clobbered by the event type. All payload reads move to event.payload.*
- _(patch)_ sync dependents to core 0.0.3
- _(patch)_ Fixed exports in committed package.json pointing at missing dist; vp pack rewrites them at publish time

## 0.0.2

<sub>2026-08-09</sub>

- _(patch)_
  Context in handlers and effects is now a handle (`context.get()` / `context.set()`), and `set()` replaces the whole context — so context writes emit a `change` event even without a transition. Snapshots now carry `context`, and change handlers receive the previous snapshot (`(snapshot, prev)`) for identity comparison.

## 0.0.1

<sub>2026-08-09</sub>

- _(patch)_
  First 0.0.1 release: actor-model state machine runtime (hierarchical states, events, effects, virtual clock) with sugar helpers, graph traversal/coverage, test harness, seeded property-based testing, and the shared Either utility — all north-star quality gates enforced.
